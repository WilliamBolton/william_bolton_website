The aim of the project was to create a small, accessible booklet in a zine format illustrating the key ideas behind the use of data, AI, and decision-support with a focus on healthcare applications. The zine is beginner friendly and tackle these topics from the prospective of those producing AI systems and those using them. It also touches on specific points including bias, accountability and responsibility. At the end there is a checklist and call to action for important, interesting aspects to consider.
